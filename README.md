# Pre-requisites

These instructions are for Ubuntu/Linux. Should work on Mac too although the paths might differ (a lot).

Either:
- Create a Python virtual environment, activate it and then `pip install scribus` & `pip install Pygments` & start scribus through the command line using `scribus-ng` (inside that virtualenv)
- pip install Pygments in your global Python installation (I don't recommend this)


# How to

Download the `.py` file and put it in `/usr/share/scribus-ng/`
